This page describes the MAAS documentation style in a concise table.

| **Element**                 | **Guidelines**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spelling and Grammar**      | Use British English (en-GB), and ensure correct spelling and grammar.                             |
| **Voice and Tone**            | Use a compact, conversational style. Write to the reader directly.                            |
| **Hyperlink Hygiene**       | Ensure all hyperlinks are functional and relevant.                                                |
| **Audience Focus**          | Target intermediate system administrators; avoid overly technical jargon.                         |
| **Headings**                | Use standard HTML. Capitalise only the first word unless itâ€™s a proper noun. Self-anchor headings. |
| **Text Styles**             | Use HTML or markdown for bold (`<strong>`, `**bold**`) and italics (`<em>`, `*italic*`). Use sparingly. |
| **Code Formatting**         | For blocks, use four-space indentation or triple-backtick. For inline, use `<code>` or backticks. |
| **Highlights and Comments**   | Use `` for important info. HTML comments are visible in browser inspections.                |
| **Linking and Embedding**     | Format hyperlinks as `[text](URL)`. Embed images with appropriate context and cropping.           |
| **Interactive Content**     | Use `<details>` and `<summary>` for collapsible sections.                                         |
| **Paragraph Writing**       | Keep paragraphs concise. Use active voice. Use relatable comparisons. Vary sentence structure. |

## Pro tips

- **Brevity is key**: Keep sentences short and to the point. Just say it.
- **Active voice**: Talk to the user. Use active rather than passive voice for clarity.
- **Clear comparisons**: Complexity loses readers. Use simple, relatable comparisons to explain concepts. You're teaching, not boasting.
- **Conversational Rhythm**: Mix short sentences with longer explanatory ones.
