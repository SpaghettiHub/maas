MAAS is not just a collection of tasks—it’s a system for discovering, preparing, deploying, and managing machines at scale. This guide introduces a workflow-driven model, mapping MAAS functions into a repeatable, structured process for infrastructure automation. Instead of treating MAAS as a set of isolated operations, this approach helps you understand, optimize, and automate the full lifecycle of machines from power-on to retirement.

## Set MAAS up for success

### Install and configure MAAS
- [Install and initialize](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-install-maas) MAAS.
- Configure [authentication and API access](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-authenticate-to-the-maas-api).
- Set up [administrators and users](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-manage-user-access).

### Configure networking
- Reflect your physical network in MAAS:
  - Define [your network](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-connect-maas-networks).
  - Enable [DHCP](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-customise-maas-networks#p-9070-dhcp-management) on management networks.
  - Manage [DNS](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-customise-maas-networks#p-9070-dns-management) resolution.
- Enable [network discovery](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-customise-maas-networks#p-9070-network-discovery) for automated detection.

### Prepare MAAS for production
- Add rack controllers for better performance and isolation.
- Add region controllers for [high availability](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-enable-high-availability).
- Configure [availability zones](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-create-an-availability-zone) for reliability.

## Add & manage servers

### Enlist machines
- Ensure servers have [working power management](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-set-up-power-drivers).
- Enable network boot to make them discoverable by MAAS.
- [Manage machines](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines) as needed.

### Commission machines
- Gather [detailed hardware information](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-commission-test-machines).
- Run custom commissioning scripts.
- Review commissioning logs for errors or inconsistencies.

### Test machines
- Validate hardware with [built-in MAAS tests](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-run-tests-cpu-storage-etc).
- Run custom test scripts.
- Review [test logs](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-view-test-results) to catch issues before deployment.

### Tag & categorize machines
- Use manual tags for organizing hardware.
- Apply automatic tags based on hardware profiles.
- Set kernel parameters for specific machine types.

## Find & allocate resources

### Search & filter machines
- Use [search filters](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-filter-machines-by-parameters) to find machines that meet specific criteria.
- Locate machines with specific hardware, tags, or availability zones.

### Collaborate with teams
- [Allocate machines](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-allocate-a-machine) to specific users, teams, or projects.
- Define resource pools for controlled access.

## Deploy machines

### Deploy to different environments
- [Deploy to disk](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-deploy-machines) for persistent workloads.
- [Deploy in memory](https://maas.io/docs/release-notes-and-upgrade-instructions#p-9229-capabilities-added-in-maas-35) for ephemeral workloads.
- [Deploy as a VM host](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-deploy-as-a-vm-host) to manage virtualization.

### Customize deployment
- Apply custom curtin scripts for pre-deployment hardware configuration.
- Apply [custom cloud-init scripts](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-deploy-with-cloud-init-config) for post-deployment software configuration.
- Use custom images or [build your own images](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-build-maas-images).
- Enlist running machines without deploying them.
- Enable hardware synchronization for optimized performance.

### Monitor & access deployments
- Track deployment progress in real-time.
- [Log in to deployed machines](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-ssh-into-a-machine) for verification.

## Manage machine life-cycles

### Release & recycle machines
- [Erase disks](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-erase-disks-on-release) and [return machines to an idle state](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-release-a-machine).
- Run custom release scripts (e.g., restore a DPU to a predefined state).

### Improve performance, reliability, and security
- Use [Prometheus and Loki](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-monitor-maas) to monitor performance.
- Deploy a [real-time kernel](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-deploy-a-real-time-kernel) for better response.
- [Enhance MAAS security](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-enhance-maas-security).
- Manage cryptographic security with [TLS](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-implement-tls).
- [Integrate Vault](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-integrate-vault) for secrets management.
- Improve network security with an [air-gapped MAAS](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-configure-an-air-gapped-maas).
- Deploy a [FIPS-compliant kernel](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-deploy-a-fips-compliant-kernel) for hardened operations.

## Troubleshoot & automate
- Identify [trouble spots](https://maas.io/docs/maas-troubleshooting-guide) before they become major issues.
- Monitor [logs](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-use-logging), test failures, and deployment problems.
- Mark machines as [broken](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-mark-a-machine-as-broken) or [fixed](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-mark-a-machine-as-fixed).
- Use [rescue mode](https://maas.io/docs/how-to-provision-machines#p-9078-enter-rescue-mode) for debugging machine issues.
- Automate fixes and repeated actions with custom scripts.

## Summary: The end-to-end MAAS workflow
- **Set up MAAS and networking** → Make sure MAAS can see and manage your environment.
- **Discover and prepare machines** → Add, enlist, commission, test, and tag.
- **Find and allocate the right resources** → Assign machines to projects and teams.
- **Deploy with custom settings** → Choose OS, kernel, cloud-init, and monitoring.
- **Manage reliability and performance** → Optimize infrastructure and handle failures.
- **Troubleshoot and automate** → Ensure long-term efficiency with proactive monitoring and effective scripting.

This structured approach guides you through **the full lifecycle of MAAS**, making it clear **what needs to be done at each stage** while allowing flexibility for different environments.
