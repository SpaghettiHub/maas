We strive to listen to users and deliver in-demand features. We cannot promise to fulfil every request or do so immediately. This page explains how to file a feature request.

If you're certain about your request, go ahead and create a new Features post on [Discourse](https://discourse.maas.io/c/features/15)**^**.  If you have an idea but are not sure how to present it, make sure that your feature idea:

- Addresses a common problem.
- Clearly describes well-articulated needs and real-world scenarios.
- Includes detailed user stories and use cases.
- Is clearly described, allowing us to understand both the 'what' and the 'how'.
- Includes contact details for follow-up questions.
 
The more compelling your case, the greater the chances it will appear in a future release.
