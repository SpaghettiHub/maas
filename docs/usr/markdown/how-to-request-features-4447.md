User feedback drives MAAS development. Feature requests help us understand what real-world problems you need solved. While we cannot guarantee every request will be implemented, clear, well-structured requests increase the chance of adoption.


## Step 1 – Choose your path
- Have a clear request? Post directly in [Discourse: Features](https://discourse.maas.io/c/features/15).
- Exploring an idea? Use the checklist below to shape it before posting.


## Step 2 – Shape your feature request
A strong feature request:
- Addresses a common problem – not just a one-off scenario.
- Describes needs in real-world terms – what you’re trying to achieve.
- Includes user stories and use cases – concrete examples.
- Explains the “what” and the “how” – what you need, and how you expect it to work.
- Provides contact details – so we can follow up.


## Step 3 – Post your request
1. Go to [MAAS Discourse: Features](https://discourse.maas.io/c/features/15).
2. Click New Topic.
3. Add a clear title and summary.
4. Paste your prepared details.
5. Submit.


## Safety nets
- Not sure if it’s already requested? Search the Features category first.
- Concerned about sharing details? Remove any sensitive information before posting.
- Need help drafting? Start a discussion in the [Users category](https://discourse.maas.io/c/users) to refine your idea.

If you're certain about your request, go ahead and create a new Features post on [Discourse](https://discourse.maas.io/c/features/15). If you have an idea but are not sure how to present it, make sure that your feature idea:

- Addresses a common problem.
- Clearly describes well-articulated needs and real-world scenarios.
- Includes detailed user stories and use cases.
- Is clearly described, allowing us to understand both the 'what' and the 'how'.
- Includes contact details for follow-up questions.
 
The more compelling your case, the greater the chances it will appear in a future release.
