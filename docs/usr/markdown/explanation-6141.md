Understand MAAS by exploring three core areas: machines, MAAS-managed infrastructure, and reliability tools.  Each section connects you to concepts and tasks that keep your data center running smoothly.

## Machines

* Machine basics: [Machine basics](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-machine-basics) -- Learn about MAAS machines and how they are characterized.
* Machine life-cycle: [Machine life-cycle](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-the-machine-life-cycle) -- See how MAAS takes a machine from discovery to deployment, with clear stages along the way.
* Commissioning machines: [Commissioning machines](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-commissioning-machines) -- Learn how MAAS collects and records detailed hardware profiles before deployment.
* Machine customization: [Machine customization](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-machine-customization) -- Configure storage, networking, and other settings to match your workload needs.
* Deploying machines: [Putting machines to work](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-deploying-machines) -- Commission, allocate, and deploy machines in a consistent, repeatable process.
* Images: [Standard and custom OS images](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-images) -- Select from standard images or build custom ones to suit your operating environment.
* LXD projects: [LXD projects](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-lxd-projects) -- Use LXD projects to run lightweight virtual machines on demand.
* Machine groups: [Machine groups](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-machine-groups) -- Organize machines into different kinds of groups for management, automation, and quick recognition.

## MAAS-managed infrastructure

* Networking overview: [MAAS networking](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-maas-networking) -- Manage DHCP, DNS, NTP, network discovery, and the underlying infrastructure from one integrated platform.
* Controllers: [Region and rack controllers](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-controllers) -- Deploy and operate region and rack controllers to coordinate all provisioning activity.

## Reliability tools

* Performance overview: [Performance tools](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-maas-performance) -- Monitor MAAS performance and identify areas for optimization.
* Event catalog: [MAAS events](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-maas-events) -- Track every action and state change for troubleshooting and auditing.
* Logging: [Logs as troubleshooting tools](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-maas-logging) -- Review and filter MAAS logs to pinpoint issues quickly.
* Security: [Security concepts](https://canonical.com/maas/docs/about-maas-security) -- Apply MAAS security tools to keep your deployment hardened.
