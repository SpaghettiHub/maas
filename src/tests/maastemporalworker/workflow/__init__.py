"""Testing utilities for Temporal workflows.

Provides interceptors and assertions to track and validate activity and child workflow
calls during testing.

Usage
-----
Use the provided fixtures in your tests:

    async def test_my_workflow(temporal_calls: TemporalCalls, worker_test_interceptor):
        async with Worker(
            ...,
            ...,
            interceptors=[worker_test_interceptor],
        ):
            await client.execute_workflow(...)

            # Assert
            temporal_calls.assert_activity_called_once("activity1")
            temporal_calls.assert_activity_called_with("activity2", task_queue="test")
            temporal_calls.assert_activity_calls("validate", "process", "notify")

            temporal_calls.assert_child_workflow_not_called("my-wf")

See `TemporalCalls` for the full list of assertions.
