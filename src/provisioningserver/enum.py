    Enum-like classes have the following structure:

      class MyEnum:
          VAL1 = "value1"
          VAL2 = "value2"

    Each element in a 2-tuple, with the enum value both as database value and
    human readable value (e.g. (("value1", "value1"), ("value2", "value2")) for
    the example above).

    If a `transform` callable is provided, it's called on the human-readable
    value to get a processed version.

    TODO:
      This should be dropped and classes become subclasses of django.db.models.TextChoices
      once we move to Django 3.0 which has native support for Enum types.
      The `choices` property of TextChoices replaces this function.
